# lenv-rs

Manage symlinks from a root file to multiple destinations.

Useful for monorepos that use a single `.env` file as a source of truth for many child projects.

## Usage

In the root of your project:

1. Create a `.env` (or other named) file you want to symlink
2. Create a `.lenv` file with the destination locations to symlink to, such as:

```
project/a/.env
project/b/.env
```

3. TBD

Use the `-help` flag to see all usage instructions.
